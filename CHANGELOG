v2.2.0
======

* Added forward year support

By default the financial year is reported as the year in which the financial year starts. e.g. 2008-09 is reported as 2008.
However, some countries it is reported as 2008-09 is reported as 2009. You can now make this setting using

Date.use_forward_year! and report the currently set as Date.uses_forward_year?
The value can be reset using Date.reset_forward_year!
