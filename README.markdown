# Fiscali: Fiscal Year based calculations

Fiscali provides methods on your Date and Time classes to jump around dates in your Financial Year.

You can specify your financial year zone and if you don’t know your zone, just provide the month your financial year begins.

## Installing

    gem install fiscali

## Using in your Rails project

In Rails projects, include Fiscali in the Gemfile, and run `bundle install` to install the gem:

    gem 'fiscali'

Next, create an initializer for configuration Fiscali:

    config/initializers/fiscali.rb

Either provide your Date/Time class your start zone:

    Date.fiscal_zone = :india

Or if set the exact start month—for example, April:

    Date.fy_start_month = 4

You can also determine the default for Year Forward by adding this to the same initializer file:

    Date.use_forward_year!
    Time.use_forward_year!

To revert back to the default:

    Date.reset_forward_year!
    Time.reset_forward_year!

“Year Forward” refers to the standard name for a fiscal year. For example:

* If FY 2008 spans 2008–2009, set to false or don’t include in initializer file.
* If FY 2008 spans 2007–2008, set to true in initializer file.

Note that for every configuration you make, you will need to make it to every class (Date, Time, and DateTime) independently. For example:

    Date.fiscal_zone = :india
    Time.fiscal_zone = :india
    DateTime.fiscal_zone = :india

### Default options

By default, the financial year start in January.

Supported zones are:

    { india: 4, uk: 4, us: 10, pakistan: 7, australia: 7, ireland: 1, nz: 7, japan: 4}

By default, the year forward is false, meaning the term FY 2008 spans 2008–2009 years.

## Date or Time Class Methods

### Fiscal Zone and FY Start Month

    Date.fy_start_month
    => 1
    Date.fiscal_zone = :india
    => :india
    Date.fy_start_month
    => 4
    Date.fiscal_zone
    => :india
    Date.fy_start_month = 7
    => 7
    Date.fy_start_month
    => 7
    Date.fiscal_zone
    => nil

#### Year Forward (Assume Date.today is 1st May 2009 and the fy_start_month = 4)

    Date.uses_forward_year?
    => false
    Date.today.financial_year
    => 2009

    Date.use_forward_year!
    => true
    Date.today.financial_year
    => 2010
    Date.uses_forward_year?
    => true

If you want to add your own fiscal zone

    RisingSun::Fiscali::FISCAL_ZONE.merge!(:my_own_zone => 2)

should do the trick.
